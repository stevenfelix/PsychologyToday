Our friendly and experienced team of doctors offers the best, most evidence-based practices in the treatment of psychiatric illness, neurocognitive assessment, educational testing, and school consultation. Our clinicians focus on the integration of treatment, education, collaboration, and partnership to help individuals, couples, and families reach their goals and improve the quality of their lives. Our main focus is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and we are one of the few practices in the Boston/Cambridge area to offer specific, guided, and collaborative CBT support for clients of all ages and backgrounds. If you have suffered from a anxiety or depression, and have found the typical psychotherapy approach ineffective, our clinicians offer specific strategies to reduce your symptoms. We pride ourselves on using collaborative, research-supported models for returning clients to their normal levels of functioning, including cognitive reframing, stress-reduction (e.g., diaphragmatic breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation), guided exposure, and biofeedback for understanding your body's response to stress. We combine compassionate listening and active intervention to produce lasting, life-changing results.                       At Life Changes Group we recognize that finding appropriate behavioral healthcare can be a daunting task. Many of you have already spent hours or days searching online, calling insurance companies, meeting with general practitioners, or asking friends if they ""know of anyone"" who can help you make the changes you desire. Seeking behavioral healthcare is challenging enough without these additional hurdles. Our goal at Life Changes Group is to simplify the process of looking for appropriate treatment and accelerate the process of getting appropriate treatment. We appreciate that many of our clients are at a crossroads in their lives, already feeling vulnerable, confused, and unsure whether change is possible. The shared philosophy of our clinicians is that change is possible, and through education, collaboration, and thoughtful treatment goals everyone is capable of finding that change. We develop an individualized and structured recovery plan for each client, focused on the biological, social, and emotional foundations of the specific problem, including: 1) Comprehensive intake and assessment 2) Collaborative goal-setting and measurable objectives 3) Psychoeducation and literature review 4) Symptom-focused treatment and weekly monitoring 5) Collaboration with other health professionals 6) Family education and support 7) Relapse prevention                       Life Changes Group recruits the best and the brightest clinicians from around the country to provide consultation, assessment, and psychiatric services to our clients. All of our clinicians have been carefully selected based upon our mission to provide the highest quality healthcare without exception. All of our staff have been trained at APA-approved doctoral programs and are actively involved in teaching, research, and publication.  Many of our clinicians have faculty appointments or are otherwise affiliated with respected hospitals and institutions in the greater-Boston area, including: Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, and University of Massachusetts Medical School. Our doctors provide comprehensive services to address the emotional needs of individuals, couples, families, and blended families. We are LGBT-sensitive and work with many clients whom have found traditional psychotherapy approaches an unwanted judgment of their personal decisions and lifestyle. In addition to focused behavioral therapy, we also offer medication management, neurocognitive testing, and group psychotherapy so that clients are not forced to ""shop"" for different services elsewhere, but can feel comfortable in knowing that all of their treatment providers are working in tandem to support their emotional needs. We are client-driven and client-focused."	3		8500 Massachusetts			Yes	"Anxiety, Depression, Testing and Evaluation"	3	"ADHD, Addiction, Alcohol Abuse, Anger Management, Asperger, Autism, Behavioral Issues, Bipolar Disorder, Career Counseling, Child or Adolescent, Chronic Impulsivity, Chronic Pain, Coping Skills, Developmental Disorders, Divorce, Drug Abuse, Dual Diagnosis, Eating Disorders, Emotional Disturbance, Family Conflict, Gambling, Grief, Infertility, Internet Addiction, LGBT issues, Learning Disabilities, Life Coaching, Medication Management, Obsessive-Compulsive (OCD), Parenting, Peer Relationships, Relationship Issues, School Issues, Self Esteem, Sex Therapy, Sexual Abuse, Sexual Addiction, Sleep or Insomnia, Spirituality, Substance Abuse, Transgender, Trauma and PTSD, Video Game Addiction, Weight Loss"	44	"Elderly Persons Disorders, Impulse Control Disorders, Mood Disorders"	3	"Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian"	3		0	"Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Biofeedback, Cognitive Behavioral (CBT), Eclectic, Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), Family / Marital, Family Systems, Interpersonal, Mindfulness-based (MBCT), Motivational Interviewing, Neurofeedback, Psychoanalytic, Psychodynamic, Psychological Testing and Evaluation"	14	Allston_192962.txt	https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_detail.php?profid=1929622	Kaynaz Mehta	counselor	"ma, lmhc"	Reading	"Therapy is about understanding you.

Geared to individuals 18 years and older, our approach combines robust psychiatric services with intensive psychosocial care, focusing equally on reducing the psychosocial damage caused by stigma, loss of social identity and institutionalization, as on treating psychiatric illness and co-occurring disorders. Using the best-practice ""gold standard"" community-based treatment model, Program for Assertive Community Treatment (PACT), our multidisciplinary teams of professionals - which include psychiatrists and a broad spectrum of other experts - provide rehabilitation and treatment resources to clients living, for the most part, in apartments in the community. A small number of clients receive services at our staff-supervised home called ""The Brackett House"".                       Our clients come with a wide range of psychiatric issues, but all have a common and serious complaint: the loss of their dreams. Their lives interrupted by their illness, they feel as if life itself has failed them, or that they have failed at life. Accordingly, the recovery of a sense of hope along with forward momentum in one's life, are central parts of our work with each client. Our job is to provide top-quality clinical care, with a focus on the psychosocial goals of regaining a sense of mastery and a return to the pursuit of life dreams.   We seek to re-empower our clients, helping them regain a sense of voice and control in their lives. This empowerment begins immediately, through their relationship with us. As our partner, each client helps set the course in his or her recovery.  We welcome the chance to talk with you about whether Ellenhorn can help. (800) 515-9972. Or email us at: info@ellenhorn.com                       As a psychiatric and psychosocial program, we are as focused on ameliorating the ravages of stigma, loss of social role and institutionalization, as we are focused on treating psychiatric illnesses. Autonomy and mastery are coupled with symptom reduction as primary goals for clients. Focused on individual empowerment, we treat our clients as autonomous agents in their lives, and thus deserving of an individualized outlook. We empower our clients by appreciating their unique struggles and strengths. This individualized approach is the very counter-definition of institutional care. We do not provide care in bulk. We contour our care to the individual needs of our clients.  We often say at Ellenhorn that our clients come with a wide-range of psychiatric issues, but they all suffer from one serious complaint: losing their dreams. Their lives interrupted by their illness, they feel like life itself has failed them, or that they, themselves have failed at life. Accordingly, hope, the struggle over hope, and the means to recover a sense of hope are central parts of our work. It is our job to dream of possibilities with our clients, to seek out and find these opportunities, and, in the end, to help our clients achieve their greatest potential."	9		107298 Massachusetts				"Psychosis, Dual Diagnosis, Mood Disorders"	3	"Alcohol Abuse, Anxiety, Behavioral Issues, Bipolar Disorder, Borderline Personality, Career Counseling, Depression, Eating Disorders, Family Conflict, Obsessive-Compulsive (OCD), Peer Relationships, Relationship Issues, Substance Abuse, Suicidal Ideation"	14	"Personality Disorders, Thinking Disorders"	2				0	"Attachment-based, Coaching, Cognitive Behavioral (CBT), Community Integrated Treatment, Dialectical (DBT), Eclectic, Emotionally Focused, Existential, Expressive Arts, Family Systems, Integrative, Intensive Case Management, Interpersonal, Mindfulness-based (MBCT), Motivational Interviewing, Narrative, Open Dialogue--contact us for details, Psychodynamic, Relational"	19	Arlington_215629.txt	https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_detail.php?profid=21562961	Stanley M Cole	psychiatrist	md	Somerville	"I practice a personal kind of psychiatry that is disappearing in the era of highly managed psychiatric care and the fifteen minute medication visit.

The vulnerability they share is feeling out of control with food, and a preoccupation with eating and weight that drains their lives of valuable energy.                       The Feeding Ourselves approach combines psychological awareness with behavioral techniques for establishing a positive relationship to food-tools which can lead to weight loss and lasting change.  Our staff of highly qualified professionals includes psychologists, mental health counselors, nutritionists, and exercise therapists."			6043 Massachusetts			Yes	"Eating Disorders, Weight Loss, Obesity"	3	"Anxiety, Child or Adolescent, Coping Skills, Depression, Divorce, Dual Diagnosis, Emotional Disturbance, Peer Relationships, Relationship Issues, Self Esteem"	10	"Dissociative Disorders, Impulse Control Disorders, Mood Disorders, Personality Disorders"	4				0	"Coaching, Cognitive Behavioral (CBT), Dialectical (DBT), Emotionally Focused, Family Systems, Interpersonal, Mindfulness-based (MBCT)"	7	Arlington_232024.txt	https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_detail.php?profid=23202469	Alena Maple	psychologist	psyd	Arlington	"Whether you're seeking help for adjusting to a recent change or looking to break free from difficulties that keep you from enjoying life, I'm here to offer you support and guidance through the process.

The decision on which form of psychotherapy to undertake is usually based on an evaluation of 1 to 3 sessions, where a treatment plan is developed. I am interactive in my approach.                       My specialty is doing and teaching psychotherapy.

Our teams are comprised of clinicians who have experience in integrated treatment for co-occurring disorders. They continuously assess individuals for signs and symptoms of both conditions. Treatment focuses on building healthy coping skills to help the individual and his family manage and recover from both illnesses. WestBridge uses evidence-based practices developed at the Dartmouth Psychiatric Research Center that are designed specifically for individuals with co-occurring disorders. Our approach helps people recover by simultaneously offering mental health and addiction services in the same setting. After a thorough assessment, we develop a personalized treatment plan that builds on the strengths and goals of each individual. WestBridge offers a wide variety of services that our clinical team customizes depending on the stage of change for each participant.  Each individual at WestBridge participates collaboratively with their family and their team in an ongoing treatment planning process to create and maintain a Personalized Achievement Agenda, which changes and evolves depending on the stage of recovery that person is experiencing.                       Wellness-based activities are integrated throughout all of our programs to foster good health. Participants practice mindfulness-based activities such as yoga and meditation; enjoy a well-balanced diet; establish a healthy sleep cycle; exercise, engage in creative arts and live in a supportive substance-free environment. Upon admission, each participant receives a sleep assessment and a comprehensive sleep hygiene plan that will enable him to better access the benefits of treatment.  Healthy sleep habits can contribute to decreased psychiatric symptoms, cravings and relapse; improved daily functioning; and reduction in risk for weight gain, diabetes, low immune system functioning, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. WestBridge's Sleep Coaches assist participants with developing sleep-promoting nightly routines, working with them after-hours in their homes to reinforce positive changes.  Each of our men's residential programs employs a full-time chef who prepares healthy and delicious meals for participants on a daily basis. In addition, participants in all of our levels of care participate in regular exercise.  Our New Hampshire location utilizes harm reduction and smoking cessation for tobacco users. Our newest campus in Brooksville, FL is tobacco-free, and also includes an on-site swimming pool, tennis court and basketball court.                       As a family founded organization WestBridge is committed to engaging the strengths of the family in the treatment process.  Family Education and Support (FES) fosters respect, trust, hope, and empowerment for all parties involved in the treatment process, so that true partnerships in recovery can be formed.  FES is a core component of WestBridge's treatment approach in which every individual and their family participates. The basis of FES is education and skill building.  Participants and their families meet on a weekly basis with our clinical team to experience up to 20 educational modules regarding mental illness, medication, substance use, and principles of communication. The model is designed to empower families to utilize all members' input in arriving at solutions to problems and developing plans to accomplish goals together. FES helps participants and their families to reduce tension and stress in the family; enable family members to relinquish the role of crisis responder and regain the role of family member.  Participation in FES helps everyone involved master new techniques to manage mental illness and addiction and to communicate effectively."	10		03076 New Hampshire				"Dual Diagnosis, Psychosis, Mood Disorders"	3	"ADHD, Addiction, Alcohol Abuse, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, Coping Skills, Depression, Drug Abuse, Gender-specific treatment for men, Medication Management, Sleep or Insomnia, Substance Abuse, Trauma and PTSD"	13	Thinking Disorders	1				0	"Coaching, Cognitive Behavioral (CBT), Cognitive Remediation, Family / Marital, Family Education and Support, Humanistic, Interpersonal, Mindfulness-based (MBCT), Motivational Interviewing, Wellness"	10	Belmont_207025.txt	https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_detail.php?profid=207025155	Katherine McHugh	drug & alcohol counselor	"e-ryt, ladci, lmhc, cps, cai"	Osterville	"Kate is a dually licensed Massachusetts Clinician with masters level advanced degrees in both Business and Counseling.

At CECT, we continually monitor your child's progress in order to individualize treatment and maximize gains. We do this by both using proven assessment tools and listening closely to the children and families we work with, ensuring that everyone takes an active part in goal-setting and treatment. These careful assessments help us go far beyond a child's diagnosis; we can focus on what the child and family hope to change. One of our primary goals is to help children develop resiliency - an internal sense of stability that allows them to face the challenges of daily life. It's the sense of empowerment children have when they realize they have control over their feelings and behavior, and enhances their ability to grow and thrive.                       At CECT, we equip children and their parents with a toolbox of skills to successfully navigate the inevitable challenges and stresses life presents. Our goal is to teach a range of techniques to develop healthier behaviors and thoughts, overcome obstacles, build confidence, and develop resiliency. We aim to give children and families the skills to meet their current challenges and to help them thrive throughout all the stages of development.

The Center for Effective Child Therapy focuses on care that works for children using evidence-based practices such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This means that we help children and families using effective, sustainable treatments that have withstood rigorous clinical testing. We measure and track results to hold ourselves accountable to children and families.

Feelings of depression, anger, loneliness, anxiety, or being stuck can be understood and the burden eased.

It is as  a powerful tool for self-transformation by expanding our  self-understanding and, reducing difficult symptoms.                       My clinical approach is deeply routed in psychodynamic and psychoanalytic practices. My relationship with my patients is a mutual journey of self-exploration shedding a new light to  their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It contributes to the evolving sense of inside freedom affecting the intensity of the emotional experiences in their lives                       The method of free self-exploration based on psychoanalytic approach is one of the most effective methods in couple therapy. I utilize this method to help couples to explore their internal conflicts, their mutual attachment and communication style.

Our philosophy is that eating disorders are multidimensional problems caused by a combination of factors. As a result, our treatment programs focus not only on reducing the eating disorder symptoms but also on understanding their development and function. We offer a complete spectrum of recovery services to support the continuity of care and help clients achieve lasting recovery.                       Our 25-bed Residential Program provides 24-hour support to medically stable females struggling with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or a binge eating disorder. We have two residential floors; one dedicated to girls and women ages 12-20, and one for women age 21 and older. The Partial Hospital Program (PHP) (Day) structure offers support and treatment to both male and female adolescent and adults clients and allows them to remain in their communities and practice their newly-acquired self management skills at home in the evenings. Our Adult Intensive Outpatient Program (Day and Evening programs available) is for individuals 18 years and older. Our unique approach provides an opportunity to work intensely with clients while they are functioning in their everyday lives. This enables us to teach them the skills which will help them navigate the difficulties and stresses in their lives without resorting to their eating disorder as a way of coping.                       Our Adolescent Intensive Outpatient Program (Day and Evening programs available) is designed to address the needs of adolescent males and females ages 12-17. The IOP model is ideal for this age group as they are able to receive a higher level of care than weekly outpatient appointments allow without having to leave school for inpatient, residential, or partial hospital treatment. In the Outpatient Programs, our multidisciplinary team of psychologists, social workers, counselors and registered dieticians provides comprehensive outpatient services including: consultations, individual therapy, nutrition counseling, family/Couples therapy, monthly family/friends support group, and referral to physicians with specialty in the field of eating disorders.

It's about raising expectations, and there is both hope and risk in deciding to accept the consequences of wanting something more.  Most of us begin therapy unaware of the peculiarities of our personal histories. The often harsh patterns of interaction that have been carried through generations, are home, they seem normal, and thus, are often invisible. Yet they  have stealthily shaped our personality from birth.                       Though sometimes painful, this work is also the ground upon which to build a sturdier self.  It helps you to interrupt the cycle of destructive connection, but also to find the parts of yourself that you truly appreciate.

Awareness of these patterns opens up greater possibility for personal transformation and improvements in one's self-esteem, mood states, relationships, work, and general life direction.

Psychotherapy provides a unique opportunity to explore personal issues in an environment of trust and respect. I appreciate the courage it takes to work through problems. Emotional pain can signal that one is called upon to make changes or understand things in a new light.

But they are workable. My interest is teaching practical, applicable skills to untangle from unwanted patterns and cultivate new ones. This approach works more with direct experience, less in talking about what happened in past days or years. As a yoga and meditation teacher, I help clients learn how to work with patterns that persist in the body, despite rational understanding that they ""shouldn't"" still occur. This combination of working with body and mind is comprehensive, empowering and practical.                       Working with both body and mind is very effective. A client suffering from anxiety, for example, might first learn a physical practice to regulate the nervous system. We might then work with beliefs that contribute to the anxiety, and then work toward developing new, more adaptive and fulfilling behaviors.                       The skills I teach are practical and applicable in real life to produce sustainable self-mastery.

Our group-based practice was founded upon the fundamental belief that adolescents work best in a positive, strength-based approach.  We utilize CBT and DBT principles and our clinicians share 50 years of experience working directly with adolescents and parents.  Our office is conveniently located at 363 Massachusetts Avenue in Lexington, Massachusetts.  All groups are co-lead and provide an 8-week curriculum treating no more than 8 clients in each group.  Homework is provided to reinforce learning between sessions and all clients receive a one-to-one intake to evaluate that each client is appropriate for the group sessions.                       Our Introduction to DBT Group works with up to 8 adolescents struggling with emerging BPD, depression, anxiety and trauma who benefit from a skill building group containing DBT modules.  Each 6 month group accepts clients on a rolling admission basis and covers all four DBT modules through our curriculum, including distress tolerance, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness and mindfulness.  Groups are co-facilitated by two Behavioral-Tech clinicians with years of experience working with adolescents in group-based settings.  Clients are asked to complete an intake appointment to identify treatment goals and discuss past treatment successes.

Everything that we think and feel, our emotional style, our subtle beliefs about ourselves and the world and our moods are all reflected in the body.Over our lifetime we all develop underlying unconscious postures and patterns that help us defend against hurts and get through the challenges of life.

A team that might include a psychiatrist, nurse, therapist, family therapist and case manager help you figure out the best way to improve safety and functioning, and set the course for lasting change. We try to keep you moving forwards, limiting inpatient detox or hospitalization through support and sophisticated pharmacology. Because force creates resistance, we enhance your motivation, determination and skill through reason, compassion, and step-wise success. We work on many levels, depending on where your strengths and preferences are and what feels the greatest bang for the buck: neurobiological, behavioral, emotional, cognitive, vocational, social and existential. We work efficiently, but know that sometimes rapid transformation is achieved when we slow down, attend, feel. We want you to leave feeling better, being better at feeling, and with biology, skills and relationships that will sustain your recovery.                       We are scientific rather than dogmatic. We embrace harm reduction and moderation training. Our interventions are respectful and gentle, not confrontational. The pharmacology is collaborative - you'll understand why each option is presented and we'll work with you whatever path you choose. The therapy is tailored not one fits all. Sometimes we use DBT or contingency management, sometimes AEDP (experiential and emotion focused), sometimes in-the-field coaching, sometimes meditation. Each choice is a product of your preference and our suggestion and is delivered by an expert. For opiate addiction, we strongly advocate medications including buprenorphine and naltrexone over abstinence because decades of research show many lives are saved. But again, we'll stick with you as you learn what's right for you right now.                       We only employ deeply trained, deeply experienced, deeply kind people; respected experts in their fields who want to work here because they know the sum is greater than its parts, that complex issues demand complex approaches, and have seen great results from excellent collaborative care. We've decades of training (Cornell, Harvard) between us and are all constantly learning new approaches and monitoring our own standards through training, supervision and data.

Eating Disorders are symptoms of something that needs attention in our lives; they are an attempt to solve and manage difficult feelings, but result in the inability to understand and accept one's authentic self. Working towards recovery, client can uncover their genuine selves and reclaim their confidence.                       The end of a marriage can be emotionally traumatic.

I am a clinical psychologist with a private practice in Newton. I have over 10 years of experience working with a wide variety of clients in different settings. My practice involves current research-supported treatments for anxiety, OCD, depression and eating disorders. I primarily use cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which is a collaborative approach where will we work together to better understand how your thoughts, feelings and behaviors interact, contribute to and maintain your symptoms. The goal of treatment is to learn skills to help you feel better currently and that you can use long-term to promote resiliency and improve emotional well-being.                       Throughout my career, I have been interested in the comorbidity (co-occurrence) of psychological symptoms. For example, people often experience both anxiety and depression.

If it feels like walls have developed that are keeping you from being able to talk to your partner or to fully enjoy your relationship, then couples therapy can help.  Together, we will come to understand what is getting in the way of connection and develop strategies and solutions for changing how you and your partner communicate. Conflicts in a relationship are natural yet they can create distance if not handled skillfully.  Therapy will help you to learn ways of managing conflict that create closeness.

Our bodily symptoms, moods, relationship issues, dreams--are messengers with important information from a part of us that's trying to tell us something. Relational, situational, and attitudinal glitches all contain helpful messages that want to be welcomed into conscious awareness. By learning the language of our body-mind, we can find out what it is we're trying to tell ourselves. Getting the message eases our difficulties, and transforms our symptoms into healing awareness and wisdom.

Anxiety, obsessiveness and depressed feelings can be significantly reduced while I teach clients how to govern the mind, creating new habits and strategies. As a practitioner of mindfulness who has attended many Insight Meditation retreats, I can share with you the benefits of attention  from both personal and professional experience.                       I teach new ways to manage your mind, release yourself from negative thoughts and emotions.  Mindfulness, cognitive restructuring and compassion practice skills are taught to help you anchor the wandering mind into a more realistic and compassionate state. These interventions offer short term relief and long-term benefits and structural changes in the brain.

We cover up these longings with worries, distractions or even addictions.  And, fundamentally, we all face a confusing paradox: even as we crave to satisfy our longings, we also fear, and often sabotage, getting what we want... whether it's success, love, intimacy, sobriety, or purpose.  Therapy is a place to get curious about these longings and to explore what stands in the way.                       Together, we can create new patterns of relating - patterns that foster a restored sense of self and purpose, fulfilling connections, and vitality.  In therapy we will embrace joy, sadness, grief, and hope. Through this process, we can find a way to manage what's been intolerable and to create space for spontaneity, joy and possibility.

I respect the abilities that people bring to the challenges of life and their capacities to make changes. I treat the person not the diagnosis.                       Dynamic psychotherapy studies internal conflict to alleviate tension. It tends to be eclectic, taking techniques from a variety of sources.  This form of therapy is effective for a wide range of mental health symptoms, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic and stress-related physical ailments.                       I am committed to maintaining confidentiality and privacy. I do not discuss or otherwise disclose case material with exception to legal limits of confidentiality. Medical plans require full disclosure of treatment plans this would conflict with my ability to provide confidential treatment.

As a spiritual counselor, I will guide and support you in remembering who you really are, beyond the roles and  routines of daily life, and the patterns you have developed throughout your lifetime that keep you from feeling peaceful, authentic, and at ease with yourself.  Having studied trans-personal, or soul-based, psychology for many years, I believe that life offers us opportunities to learn and grow, and that when we begin with  compassion and acceptance of ourselves, we can uncover meaning and purpose, even in our pain, and ultimately find freedom and joy in our lives.                       My passion is to assist you in feeling more alive and happy in your life.  I do this through body-centered therapy, guiding you in being present, trusting what arises, and allowing it to be expressed and integrated. I trust and respect your inner wisdom, and work collaboratively with you.                       My work incorporates the wisdom of mindfulness meditation and yoga, as well as expressive arts therapies. You will experience direct body/mind healing and integration, and leave with tools to assist you in your daily life.

Release the past and embrace a new level of consciousness that promises to restructure old, destructive cognitive-behavioral patterns and false premises. The process includes tangible action steps; self-reflection and personal renewal; building honest and loving relationships; mindfulness meditation and guided visualization; ""tapping"" or EFT; developing intuition; reclaiming purpose and passion; and recognizing the Sacred in all things.
